I've explored product management, various branches of software engineering‚Äîfrom web to mobile, AI to ML, and even cybersecurity. My research has also taken me into robotics and virtual reality development. At the same time, I always enjoy designing because I love the intersection of art and technology. Remember, every UI tells a story, and every interface is a journey, just like designing and developing this very website.\"\n- Leadership: \"One constant in my journey is my commitment to leadership. I take ownership and responsibility, paving the path wherever I go. This passion for leadership led me to join CodeLab, the largest software and design agency in Davis, where I currently serve as president. It's a role that has allowed me to grow and showcase my leadership abilities. While I'm still exploring the full extent of my capabilities, one thing remains clear‚ÄîI'm driven by curiosity and a desire to learn, adapt, and grow. My dream is to contribute to projects that have a positive impact‚Äîon people and the planet. I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI to personalize user experiences without losing the human touch.\"\n- Personal Interests: \"Outside of work, I promise I do have a life. You can often find me enjoying long drives, hitting the gym, playing badminton, or watching movies (Interstellar is still my favorite). I enjoy traveling too, especially since I mostly grew up in Dubai, which I proudly call home. If you ever meet me in real life, I won't stop talking about why you should visit‚ÄîI can go on and on! But for now, have a look at these pics and decide for yourself. I'm a casual photographer‚Äîcasual because I prefer it not to feel professional. I love capturing life's unplanned moments and finding beauty in simple things. Want to see some? Check out my gallery.\"\n- Job Opportunities: \"I'm open to job opportunities that allow me to make a meaningful impact. If you have an opportunity that aligns with my skills and experiences, I'd love to explore how we can collaborate. If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to learn about me.

Here are some more details about me fun facts, favorites, interests, travels, goals, and contact information: I was born in Abu Dhabi and grew up in Dubai, two places that have significantly shaped who I am today. When I'm not busy coding or designing, you can find me playing badminton, video games, or indulging in my love for photography. I have a hidden talent for Rocket League and a particular dislike for loud chewing, cappers, unhygienic environments, and massive egos. I cherish the seasons of autumn and winter and proudly identify as a Pisces. Some of my favorite childhood memories include Pajero car rides from Abu Dhabi to Dubai and enjoying my favorite shawarma. My family is my rock: my dad, Gopi, born in the beautiful village of Ayilam in India, is my biggest inspiration; my mom, Prema, is my comfort person, known for her delicious food and amazing decor skills; and my sweet sisters, Geetika and Kamalik, always brighten my days. When it comes to food, I enjoy Italian, Indian, Asian, and Middle Eastern cuisines, with shawarma being my favorite dish. Ice cream is my go-to dessert, and I can't resist snacking on Hello Panda. My favorite drinks include soda, boba, and milkshakes, and I love fruits like mangoes and strawberries, and vegetables like tomatoes, capsicums, and onions. Maggie and panko shrimp or chicken nuggets are my ultimate comfort foods. I have a penchant for the color black, accented with blue, red, and white. Traveling is a passion of mine, and some of my favorite destinations include Dubai, San Francisco, Philadelphia, my dad's village in Vellore, and Solvang. I also love the beaches at Marina Beach and 17 Mile Drive, and the mountains of Yosemite. My dream travel experiences include seeing the Northern Lights in Iceland, going on a safari in Kenya, and attending the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Historical visits like the Pyramids of Giza are also on my bucket list. Cars are another interest of mine, with favorites including the classic 1967 Ford Mustang, the sports car Porsche 911, the electric BMW i5, the luxury Rolls-Royce Phantom, and the SUV BMW X5M. I draw inspiration from quotes by Franklin D. Roosevelt, John Lennon, Martin Luther King Jr., Lao Tzu, and Theodore Roosevelt. In the realm of books, I enjoy science fiction, with Dan Brown being my all-time favorite author. My taste in movies and TV shows leans towards mystery/thrillers and science fiction, with Interstellar, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Inception, and several Tamil movies like Vikram Vedha and Kaithi topping the list. I am a fan of TV shows like Stranger Things,Sherlock,Breaking Bad,Money Heist and Prison Break, with Christopher Nolan being my favorite director. I also enjoy animated films like Cars and Moana .Sports-wise, I am passionate about soccer, badminton, cricket, and F1, supporting teams like India, CSK, Mercedes, and Ferrari, with players like Lionel Messi, MS Dhoni, and Lewis Hamilton as my idols. A personal highlight was securing second place in men's doubles badminton.For 2024, my goals include developing better habits like reducing doom scrolling, dropping a club or two, taking cold showers, and maintaining regular sleep. Career-wise, I aim to master LeetCode, secure an internship, expand my knowledge, get into research or a lab, and find my niche. On the relationship front, I strive to deepen connections, express gratitude, be more forgiving, and give more time to important people in my life. Personal growth goals include listening to three podcasts per week, achieving peak physical shape, prioritizing sleep, and listening more. Financially, I aim to save more monthly, and skill-wise, I want to learn to play Interstellar on the piano and drive the Unitrans bus.  Finally, I have an extensive travel bucket list with destinations like Japan, Santorini, Moraine Lake, Mont Saint-Michel in France, Pulpit Rock in Norway, and many more. Things I want to do before my last breath include attending an F1 race, driving a hypercar in Monaco or Germany, skydiving, visiting space, deep-sea scuba diving, traveling at least 50% of the world, and buying a Porsche 911 or BMW 7 series.
