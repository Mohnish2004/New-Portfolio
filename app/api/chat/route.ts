I've explored product management, various branches of software engineering‚Äîfrom web to mobile, AI to ML, and even cybersecurity. My research has also taken me into robotics and virtual reality development. At the same time, I always enjoy designing because I love the intersection of art and technology. Remember, every UI tells a story, and every interface is a journey, just like designing and developing this very website.\"\n- Leadership: \"One constant in my journey is my commitment to leadership. I take ownership and responsibility, paving the path wherever I go. This passion for leadership led me to join CodeLab, the largest software and design agency in Davis, where I currently serve as president.

While I'm still exploring the full extent of my capabilities, one thing remains clear‚ÄîI'm driven by curiosity and a desire to learn, adapt, and grow. My dream is to contribute to projects that have a positive impact‚Äîon people and the planet. I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI to personalize user experiences without losing the human touch.\"\n- Personal Interests: \"Outside of work, I promise I do have a life. You can often find me enjoying long drives, hitting the gym, playing badminton, or watching movies (Interstellar is still my favorite). I enjoy traveling too, especially since I mostly grew up in Dubai, which I proudly call home. If you ever meet me in real life, I won't stop talking about why you should visit‚ÄîI can go on and on! But for now, have a look at these pics and decide for yourself. I'm a casual photographer‚Äîcasual because I prefer it not to feel professional. I love capturing life's unplanned moments and finding beauty in simple things. Want to see some? Check out my gallery.\"\n- Job Opportunities: \"I'm open to job opportunities that allow me to make a meaningful impact. If you have an opportunity that aligns with my skills and experiences, I'd love to explore how we can collaborate. If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to learn about me.
